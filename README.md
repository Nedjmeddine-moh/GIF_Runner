you can put any gif you want and i will add resizing and locking but they can move around and all but it works on linux and windows and just enter the gid runner directory and you'l see both the default which is meant for linux and a windows version since it uses GTK4 and am working on other project and making it run on windows, if you can help please give a comment that would help and thank you.
